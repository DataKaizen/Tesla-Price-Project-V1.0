# Tesla-Price-Project-V1.0
Question: What is the best Tesla on the market for Bob the buyer?

Goals for Project
- This is my first project ever and I wanted to start doing project based learning to get out of "tutorial hell"
- I'm also selling my car and the market research that I did was all useful for real life
- Start learning the Data Analyst workflow

What concepts/skills did I learn while completing this project?
- Learn how to sort data excluding my header by freezing the row/column
- Be wary when using absolute references which can mess up your columns when sorting columns
- Don't use paint when trying to draw stuff. Use common workplace tools such as MWORD, PPT, VISIO, etc
- Don't use my own car as a benchmark to compare all the other cars to. You can only use something as a benchmark for comparison if it's widely accepted like the SP500
- The importance of citing your sources/references
- When showing work on a powerpoint slide, don't include the long winded work for the initial presentation. Be sure to keep the work handy in case someone wants to see how you did it
- Learned how to use waterfall charts to easily visualize the changes to a value
- Simplify your concepts and problem as much as possible (use algebra)
- Work consistently in order to get the job done

What are some other things I could improve upon?
  - presentation itself is still bare bones (referring to V1.0)
  - use canva to make presentations more engaging
  - learn how to space words, negative space, pictures better to help people better focus
  - stay consistent with naming conventions (sometimes I would flip flop my names)
  - overtime, I should develop my own style for presentations (my goal is to make my PPTs simple and impactful)
  - make math equations clear and clean
